# Pathway-to-Computer-Science
My pathway to computer science without CS background

## Background
My majors are **statistics** and **econometrics**. The programming languages I know: Stata, Python, R, Matlab.
1. I use **Stata** to perform basic **econometric analysis**. 
2. I learnt **Python** in my spare time, knowing basic **data structure**, **pandas** packages. 
3. **Matlab** is mainly used in my favourite course: **Computational Econometrics**, tasks including simualtion, Monte-Carlo methods (important sampling, acceptance/rejection rules).
4. I use **R** most frequently (**data analysis, Bayesian inference, simulations**). 

## Why choose CS?
